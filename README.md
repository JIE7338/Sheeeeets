# Sheets
A spreadsheet software designed for CS 3312 Junior Design class.

How to run Sheets:

    ● Pre-requisites: You must have npm installed on your computer. This can be installed simply with the command 'install node' on the command line

    ● Dependent libraries that must be installed: Our server runs in the cloud so there are no additional libraries needed on top of node.

    ● Download instructions: Use git clone or download the zip file into the directory of your choice. To git clone use the command git clone https://github.com/JIE7338/Sheeeeets.git on the command line

    ● Build instructions: Using your system's command prompt, navigate to the folder Sheeeeeets/frontend/sheets and run 'npm install'. This will install all the needed npm/node dependencies needed to run the program

    ● Installation of actual application: no additional commands are needed to install the application after running 'npm install' from the previous line.

    ● Run instructions: While in the Sheeeeeets/frontend/sheets folder run npm start. This will start our program in a new tab of your default browser.

    ● Troubleshooting: If the 'nppm install' instruction does not work, mkae sure you are in the correct directory before running the command. The directory should be Sheeeeets/frontend/sheets
